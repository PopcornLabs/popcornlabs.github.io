## 2. Important Medical Disclaimer

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS CRITICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY INFORMATION.**

### 2.1 — Soothe Is Not a Medical Device or Treatment

Soothe is a wellness application that provides guided calming techniques for informational and educational purposes only. **Soothe is NOT:**

- A medical device, as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any equivalent regulatory body
- A substitute for professional mental health care, psychotherapy, counseling, or psychiatric treatment
- A substitute for prescribed medication or any treatment plan established by a licensed healthcare provider
- A diagnostic tool — the App does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical or psychological condition
- A replacement for a relationship with a qualified healthcare professional

The techniques offered by Soothe — including paced breathing, grounding exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, dive reflex activation (cold splash), distanced self-talk, yoga nidra, and gratitude meditation — are drawn from evidence-based practices. However, their inclusion in this App does not constitute medical advice, clinical recommendation, or therapeutic intervention.

### 2.2 — Crisis and Emergency Situations

**If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, or are in immediate danger, please do not rely on this App. Instead, take one of the following actions immediately:**

- **Call 911** (or your local emergency number)
- **Call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text **988** in the United States)
- **Text HOME to 741741** to reach the Crisis Text Line
- **Go to your nearest emergency room**

Soothe is not monitored by mental health professionals and cannot provide real-time crisis support. The App is not designed to replace emergency services or crisis intervention by trained professionals.

### 2.3 — Cold Splash Technique — Specific Health Warnings

The cold splash technique (dive reflex activation) involves applying cold water or cold packs to the face to activate the mammalian dive reflex. **This technique has known medical contraindications and may pose serious health risks for individuals with certain conditions, including but not limited to:**

- Cardiovascular disease, heart conditions, or history of cardiac events
- Hypertension (high blood pressure) or hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Asthma or other respiratory conditions
- Raynaud's disease or other circulatory disorders
- Epilepsy or seizure disorders
- Other neurological conditions
- Pregnancy

**You must consult your physician or qualified healthcare provider before using the cold splash technique**, particularly if you have any pre-existing medical condition. If you experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or any adverse reaction while using this technique, stop immediately and seek medical attention.

### 2.4 — General Health Precautions

Some techniques in Soothe involve controlled breathing patterns, physical relaxation, or altered states of awareness (such as yoga nidra). If you have any medical condition — including respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, or psychiatric conditions — consult your healthcare provider before using the App. Discontinue use of any technique that causes discomfort, pain, dizziness, or distress and consult a healthcare professional.

### 2.5 — No Professional Relationship

Use of Soothe does not create a patient-provider, therapist-client, or any other professional healthcare relationship between you and Popcorn Labs or any of its employees, contractors, or affiliates.
